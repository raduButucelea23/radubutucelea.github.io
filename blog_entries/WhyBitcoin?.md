# Why ₿itcoin?
*November 5, 2022*

A couple of months back I decided to make a career change and dedicate my full-time attention to learn in more detail about Bitcoin and the ecosystem surrounding the protocol. Breaking the news to friends, family and acquaintances has triggered mixed reactions ranging from "Wow, cool!" to "Haha, really?! are these things even serious?", perfectly sensible given the overwhelming amount of information and noise we get exposed to day in and day out. I did, however, think it may be useful to write down the reasoning behind the decision as well as painting a picture of my journey so far, if not for the record, in the hope that it may serve as a guideline for others thinking about breaking into the space and not knowing precisely where to start.

## How did it all start?

It was 2017 and a lot was happening in the world. Political and social events were shaking the existing structures and digital technology was quickly becoming evermore ubiquitous. To various degrees, people were still settling into this new "mixed" reality where all of a sudden we have an astonishing amount of content and features right at our fingertips, making "abundance" the new default.

Identified so eloquently in 2011, the "software is eating the world" trend never felt more real. Pretty much every domain was about to get disrupted with consequences hard to anticipate, from autonomous cars to humanoid robots and evermore sophisticated AI that was supposed to make any effort of learning a foreign language a waste of time since anyway the most intuitive real-time translator was going to do better and for free.

Amongst all this hustle and bustle, Bitcoin and the all-new "crypto market" started capturing headlines under the pretext of "digital currencies" that will disrupt the current financial system as we know it. Unfortunately, the focus was on the price rather than the essence of their proposition which built up a wave of superficiality around the space and later on what came to feel like a Ponzi scheme-like vibe. [1]

At the time, however, I didn't have the intuition and clarity to observe this. After talking to a couple of friends and colleagues that were interested in the topic and already building their crypto portfolio, I ended up following the herd, opening a Binance account and acquiring the most "promising" tokens. The list included Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, SteIlar and IOTA. I did not read the whitepapers. I did not get Bitcoin.

## 4 years of silence, choosing a project and initial impressions

Life got on and I almost forgot about the whole crypto space for about 3 years until the end of 2020 when I stumbled upon a podcast episode in which Naval Ravikant was talking about the potential of decentralized systems offering Turing complete, smart contract capabilities and how they would reshape the way we exchange value, encode commitments, remove the need for trust in actors that can be manipulated and democratize financial services that are disproportionately available in the west but lacking in poorer regions prohibiting development and growth.

This coincided with some thoughts I was starting to fancy regarding a new professional challenge in a different industry after about a decade in the automotive sector. It didn't take long until I started dedicating whatever spare time I had available to learn more about the ecosystem and get to the details. Since we're talking about a technology that has software at its core, besides reading about it, I decided to "get my hands dirty" and apart from figuring out the use cases and problems it would solve, I should also try to learn how to program it myself. Choosing which crypto project to start with was no easy feat and had a deja-vu effect in reminding me of the conundrum I faced in 2017 in trying to find value in a sea of bs. [2]

Eventually made the call and chose to start with Ethereum mainly because of the exceptional developer support and communities as well as the native smart contracting capabilities that rendered it the "Turing complete" platform that will host the next generation of the internet: web3.

## Ethereum phase

About 85% of all the Ethereum smart contracts deployed on mainnet are written in Solidity, a JavaScript-like object-oriented programming language. A simple google search returns a staggering 98% of webclients as being written in JavaScript, which naturally makes Solidity one of the most appealing programming language choices when it comes to developer transition into the world of cryptocurrency. Couple that with ERC-20 (i.e Ethereum standard implementation template for fungible tokens) and the result is a downright Pandora's box for the ecosystem – more on this later.

Unsurprisingly, my Ethereum development spell started with Solidity and a combination of books and tutorials that I found clear, concise and easy to follow. [3] After about 2 months into my Solidity journey during which I was programming sandbox mini-projects including wallets, new tokens and vending machines I came to a point where I was rather unsure if I have a clear, rational understanding of the use cases and problems that this technology would solve for real users, in real life. I felt that NFTs, DAOs and DEXs are interesting proposals but they didn't seem anchored into the reality of everyday life nor did they seem to be practical propositions for mass adoption.

Can eth become the currency of the world? Does it make sense for big-tech services (e.g media streaming) to become blockchain based and run on Ethereum? What's with all of the fungible tokens and NFTs and how will their digital value get reconciled with the physical assets?

## The Reckoning

An individual that I admire with regard to technology topics is Paul Graham, one of the founders of YCombinator. YCombinator is one of the most successful venture capital firms ever, which turns Mr. Graham in arguably one of the most knowledgeable voices in terms of key principles underpinning most, if not all, successful technology projects. The first and arguably the most important is: "What problems is your product/technology going to solve?"

The Ethereum website describes the technology as: "Ethereum is the community-run technology powering the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of decentralized applications."

Putting Mr. Graham's question in other words, a project needs a clear mission statement to guide a focused and committed effort to deliver it. I felt that this is what Ethereum was missing.

As a consequence, I felt that Ethereum was in a position where, despite the reputation and the extraordinary development community, it lacked the fundamentals necessary for solving real-world problems and mass adoption. One of these fundamentals and arguably the most important is the incorporation of eth as the default token exchanged for any state change or interaction occurring within the blockchain, making Ethereum's whole value proposition dependent on eth's monetary policy. Mismanaged monetary policies are the root of all the evils that cryptocurrencies were supposed to solve in the first place and with an unpredictable issuance schedule as well as governance that cannot ensure immutability, I decided to pursue something different.

## The epiphany!

**Bitcoin: a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System**

Bitcoin has been accused of being basic, inflexible and certainly not suitable to deliver on the evergrowing demands of the 21st century where transactions are measured in the tens of thousands per second. To put it into perspective, a Bitcoin block is mined, on average, every 10 minutes and contains around 2000 transactions. Judging by this metric, Bitcoin seems, indeed, not suitable.

However, I discovered that Bitcoin is at times counterintuitive, which makes it hard to understand. I came to think that is the case because Bitcoin is what is called a "0 to 1" innovation, in other words something new that has not existed before. [4] The reason why such innovations are, at first, counterintuitive is that they tend to be evaluated based on the pre-existing frameworks that disregard the nuances that the new technology brings. The use case is exactly the same, but the way it is being addressed is radically different.

### A feature, not a bug..

I started digging deeper and came to realize that all those alleged downsides (e.g basic, inflexible) were actually prerequisites necessary to secure a decentralized, trustless monetary system. [5]

## And why is it important?

Understanding the mission behind the project is an essential first step but it is not sufficient to legitimize all the time, effort and resources required to deliver it. Why is it important?

Well, it turns out that for a variety of different reasons that are impractical to explain in this blog post. I urge any interested reader to pick up "The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking" by Saifedean Ammous which, despite the name, it includes a thorough description of the history of money, currencies and the monetary system concept over 6 out of the 8 chapters. I deem it a must-read even if you are not remotely interested in Bitcoin as it demystifies a whole host of abstract concepts that impact directly our everyday life and financial well-being, filling up this gap left empty by the education system.

Some of my takeaways:

1. money's sole role is to serve as a medium of exchange. It is used to measure the value of anything (e.g good, service) that is intended to be exchanged, addressing the "coincidence of wants" and enabling specialization [6]
2. Money does not have an intrinsic value and it is not acquired or held for its own sake. As described in #1 the only reason humans hold money is to be able to acquire any other market good. The money supply in circulation should be fixed.
3. Since money does not have any intrinsic value and it is only used as a "measure" and in exchange for other goods, ideally, the money supply should be fixed. If not fixed, the best money are those with the lowest stock-to-flow ratio [7]
4. Any money supply is enough to run an economy, it just needs to be divisible enough
5. "Fix the money, fix the world" may turn out to be true.. [8]

## Bitcoin's role

### Where we are and where we're headed..

What are we experiencing today:

- inflation which depending upon the geography, varies from 10-20% in G7 countries up to more than 80% in Turkey
- raising concerns over financial censorship and questions such as "are the funds in my bank account even mine?"
- high costs associated with banking from maintenance costs to transfer or currency conversion fees

What Bitcoin brings:

- fixed monetary supply
- decentralized, permissionless, trustless and immutable – in other words, there is no central authority, no sign-up process, and nobody to trust but the protocol. Although in theory it can be modified, due to the built-in economic incentives, it makes it impossible in practice
- internet native

## How?

I hadn't thought about it until I read somewhere, but it turns out that the majority of technological innovations are not discoveries that, as if by magic, came out of nowhere. They are rather different ways of combining pre-existing technologies and research. This can be referred to as the power of composability and Bitcoin is just another example of it.

Some of the main building blocks used in Bitcoin:

- digital network technologies:
  - enable communication between participants without the need for a central server
  - enables exchanging the historical ledger as well as new transactions
  - ensure that anyone can connect or disconnect at will with the ability to resume participation
- cryptography for:
  - ensuring that the history of transactions cannot be modified without making it obvious to all participants which will subsequently reject it
  - digital signatures [9]
- game theory: building a system of economic incentives that assumes rational agents will act in their own interest

Oversimplified, but by combining elements like the ones listed above, the Bitcoin protocol is up and running for 13 years, providing a medium of exchange for electronic cash that is decentralized, permissionless and immutable.

## The paradox of evolution

I hear technologists talk all the time about the unpredictability of a product's evolution. Whilst certainly a system can be designed to satisfy a set of requirements correlated with a number of use cases, the aforementioned power of composability coupled with human creativity will lead to unpredictable new applications that solve a whole host of new problems.

The lightning network is an example of such an application. It leverages the properties that the Bitcoin system enables to expand the number of use cases that the ecosystem addresses.

There are many more. I will cover the Bitcoin layer 2 space in more detail in a future post.

## Final thoughts

I came to think that the Bitcoin system offers one of the biggest opportunities we have today to improve our human condition and experience.

Beyond the political or philosophical lenses that such posts might be judged from, I think it is objectively desirable to have a system that gives all of us the right to have a "meter" for economic activity that knows no boundaries and nobody can change.

I find it extraordinary that it came to be since when judged separately, the independent pieces can come across as counterintuitive, but when looked at holistically, it is a technological masterpiece.. and everything makes sense!

## Notes

[1] According to online sources, in 2017 there were a total of 789 cryptocurrencies being traded. A big part have been viewed as just "get-rich-quick" schemes that took profit of the "crypto" hype and issued crypto tokens with no real, feasible application. The "founding teams" behind these projects put up for sale only a part of the total number of tokens issued, keeping the rest and selling thereafter in a practice suspected to be infringing the securities laws. This, however, does not apply to all projects, with Bitcoin being the best example of having no founding team together with a token that is being "mined" (i.e real dollar energy costs are being expended to create the token), rather than just created out of "thin air".

[2] There were times when I felt that I'm either missing something or the industry is just a pathetic mockery. In 2021 there were more than 7000 projects and it felt obvious that something is wrong with this sheer craze. The traditional objective information sources (e.g media outlets, public figures) for wisdom-seeking individuals like myself were making the situation even worse (e.g Elon's promotion doggy-coin). One thing was certain: there was a real need for internet native money that anyone in digital space can access without having to go through geographical restrictions and other unnecessary hops.

[3] I admire the Ethereum community for the vast selection of clear, concise and easy-to-follow courses and tutorials that get developers, even complete beginners like myself, up and running in no time. 
Below some of the materials, courses and tutorials I have used:
- Mastering Ethereum, by Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Gavin Wood
- Scaffold-eth by Austin Griffith
- Ethereum Blockchain Developer Bootcamp With Solidity (2022), Thomas Wiesner, Ravinder Deol

[7] The stock-to-flow ratio compares the existing stock (total amount available) of something (e.g money, gold) to the flow of new production (e.g amount of gold mined during a specific year)

[8] Although the last 20 years brought us many advances that contributed directly to the improvement of human condition, the management of monetary policies have gone from bad to worse. And money is perhaps one of the most(if not the most!) important dimensions of our everyday life

[9] Digital signature = "A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents. A valid digital signature, where the prerequisites are satisfied, gives a recipient very high confidence that the message was created by a known sender (authenticity), and that the message was not altered in transit" (Wikipedia)
