### [Computer Applications (1980s–1990s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software)
Office suites, design tools, and creative software like Word, Excel, and Photoshop turned computers into everyday productivity machines.

---

### [The Web (1990–1995)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web)
Tim Berners-Lee’s creation of the World Wide Web made the internet usable for everyone by introducing URLs, HTML, and HTTP.

---

### [The Browser (1993–1999)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser)
Mosaic and Netscape made the web visual and navigable, opening the door to mainstream internet adoption.

---

### [Search Engines (Mid–Late 1990s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_search_engine)
As the web grew, search engines like Yahoo and Google helped users find content, turning the web into an organized resource.

---

### [Mobile (2007–Present)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone)
The iPhone redefined computing with a multi-touch interface and app ecosystem. Smartphones became all-in-one devices used globally.

---

### [Cloud Computing (2006–Present)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)
With AWS and similar platforms, computing power, storage, and services moved to the cloud, enabling scalable, global digital services.

---

### [Software is Eating the World… Connectivity and Applications (2005–Present)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0)
The rise of Web 2.0 made the internet social and participatory. Apps like [Spotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify), [Netflix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix), and [Audible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audible_(service)) extended software into every facet of life. Everything is now connected—from smart homes to cars—and powered by cloud-based services.
