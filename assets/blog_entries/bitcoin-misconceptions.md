# The common ₿itcoin misconceptions
*August 23, 2022*

## Bitcoin

Introduced anonymously to the public in 2009, it didn't take long for bitcoin to capture the headlines and become one of the most disruptive and equally controversial digital technologies created in the last couple of decades.

Whether it's due to its price volatility, socio-economic model or its claimed potential to "make the world a better place", Bitcoin is a digital system that promises to offer its users decentralized, irreversible and censorship-resistant exchange of its native currency, the bitcoin token.

As some of you with which I'm personally acquainted may already know, a while back I decided to dedicate my time to learn more about Bitcoin and eventually be able to contribute to the space. In a future post I will provide a more detailed account of my personal motivation but to begin with I would like to dedicate this post to share a couple of thoughts on some of the most popular concerns that I came across whenever I mention bitcoin to my friends, family or people I talk to.

## The price fluctuations

**Why should we trust this digital thing that drops more than 70% in value in less than 1 year?**

Before I provide my thoughts, I would like to clarify two concepts that are key to the topic:

1. **value of Bitcoin**:
   more often than not, I see the trading price of bitcoin (i.e the token) in US dollars being used to define the value of the technology. Whilst being a data point, I argue that the trading price is one of many factors that shall be considered when discussing about the value of the Bitcoin protocol

2. **example of factors influencing the trading price of bitcoin in fiat currency (e.g USD)**:
   - supply and demand: how much bitcoin is being sold vs bought in the marketplace
   - media and news. E.g: "Tesla sells 75 per cent of its Bitcoin.." or "China banned Bitcoin"..
   - monetary policy and the perceived effect: "interest rates increases", "economic slowdown", "financial crisis"
   - regulation and others

With respect to the current value of the Bitcoin protocol, I feel that this is one of those "looking behind the curtain" situations. In doing so, we observe that Bitcoin (i.e the technology) remains the same regardless of any of the factors listed above under point #2. On average, every 10 minutes, a new block is created containing transactions that are validated and added to a ledger shared amongst thousands of participants. Bitcoin features an economic incentive structure that enables the majority to agree on the state of the system and its history without the need of an "admin" or central authority, giving every network participant equal status.

Bitcoin cannot be censored. As long as you are paying a fee and don't double spend, your transaction will be included in a block and equally treated regardless of the amount of bitcoins transferred. The Bitcoin system doesn't care if you are transferring 1 billion dollars or just 50 cents, once a block containing your transaction has been validated and added to the chain, those coins are yours and nobody or nothing can revert, steal or prevent you from using them.

I would like to share one last thought on this topic regarding bitcoin's price relative to fiat currencies (e.g. USD, EUR). Although it is a relevant data point as mentioned above, I would argue it is not as significant as it may seem when thinking about the value of the technology. The main reason being that the nature of the correlation is inherently inaccurate or misleading. The bitcoin token is an asset associated to a hardcoded monetary ruleset and a fixed supply asset that nobody can change. Therefore, it is arguably impossible to accurately measure it against fiat currencies which have a constantly variable (and often inflating) supply as depicted below with the USD:

## Adoption and use cases

**But nobody is using bitcoin. I can't pay for groceries with it.**

Although the 13 years since its introduction represent a testimony to its feasibility, the 750,000+ blocks mined so far have consolidated the security and tamper-proofing of the Bitcoin network. However, if that holds true from a technology perspective, Bitcoin is still in its infancy when we think about individual adoption, possible use cases and problems it can solve.

Although impossible to determine a precise figure in terms of number of individuals owning Bitcoin (since a single user can own multiple wallets), holistically the trend indicates:

- ~100M bitcoin owners (out of which ~50% are traders)
- ~400K daily bitcoin users
- user adoption continues to trend up (Blockchain.com)

However, when contrasted with the worldwide adoption of financial services we notice two segments:

### Individuals without access to financial services (~1.7 Billion adults). Some insights:

- **Impact**: "The World Bank Group considers financial inclusion a key enabler to reduce extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity." (The World Bank, 2022)
- **Reason**: In an article regarding the unbanked in the USA, "The biggest reason for remaining unbanked may stem, at least in part, from concerns about the fees associated with bank accounts." (Forbes, 2020)
- **Entry requirements**:
  - **Bitcoin**: mobile phone, internet connection and wallet app
  - **Bank**: proof of address, passport/ ID card, email, phone number + minimum deposit requirement (arguably a hidden account opening fee)
- **Account fees**:
  - **Bitcoin**: None.
  - **Bank**: can differ depending upon account type or jurisdiction, but maintenance fees for checking accounts are common
- **Opportunity**: Anyone with a smartphone and internet connection can use Bitcoin to receive and transfer value

### Individuals with a registered bank account (~3.8 Billion)

- **Opportunity**: Anyone with a connected smartphone is a potential user. Looking at the numbers, there are billions of individuals that Bitcoin can serve better

**Why should I consider it today?**

In addition to the fundamental principles (i.e. permissionless, decentralized, immutable) with which the protocol has been designed, Bitcoin can be used as/for:

- **store of value** (e.g. for portfolio diversification) . Bitcoin is considered a digital equivalent of "gold" with better properties because:
  - constant, deterministic stock-to-flow ratio with capped supply, in other words we know precisely how many bitcoins are going to be created, when and the limit (i.e 21 million). This makes it scarce and deflationary
  - portability and storing costs. Bitcoin is digital, hence portability is not a concern and it costs nothing to store
- **low fee transaction cost**
  - example from my transaction history (note: cost can differ since fee ratio is not constant):
    - transaction over the Bitcoin network Layer 1 → Fee: 0.97$ for 161$ | 0.6%
    - transaction over the Lightning Network Layer 2 → Fee: 0.0002$ for 1$ | 0.02%
  - The Lightning Network is an application running on top of the Bitcoin protocol (hence the "layer" terminology) that leverages the fundamental characteristics of Bitcoin (e.g immutable, secure) to enable VISA/Mastercard level transaction volumes as well as micropayments

## Bitcoin as the currency of the world

**How can only 21 million coins serve 8 billion individuals?**

The Bitcoin network uses the bitcoin token (aka BTC) which has a total maximum supply of 21 million. One bitcoin token can be divisible by up to 10^8 and we call this smallest unit a satoshi (its value currently is around ~0.0002 USD). Hypothetically, if bitcoin were to trade at 10 million USD/coin this would not only turn the bitcoin market cap into 2.5x bigger than the value of today's worldwide economy, but it would also emphasize bitcoin's divisibility scale since a satoshi would still amount to 0.1 USD, or 10 cents. Furthermore, adding digits to the right of the decimal point is more than possible too if bitcoin's value soars so much that a higher divisiblity is needed. This would be akin to a stock split, the value doesn't change, you are just dividing the pie into smaller pieces. So, as you can see, it proves that in practice, there will never be a lack of "coins" or satoshis in the system.

**Do you really think there'll be a time when I will pay my bills with bitcoin?**

On whether Bitcoin will become the economic platform of the world, only time will tell. The current adoption trend alongside superior features, give it a shot. People not taking their economic security for granted, in the aftermath of the last decade's monetary policy, give it a shot.

For the unbanked, the Argentinians, Turkish, Venezuelans, Iranians, Sudanese and millions of others who had their savings and purchasing power decimated by hyperinflation, Bitcoin is necessary.

It will not happen tomorrow, and most probably it won't be a sudden shift. Nevertheless, network effects can be created by building on-ramps(e.g. stablecoins) or applications such as Lightning Network, Liquid Network, or decentralized identity that leverage Bitcoin network's fundamental features and solve incrementally more real user problems.

Then, before we know it…
